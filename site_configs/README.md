# remove_me
Script to request your data be deleted from various data brokers using CCPA.
Will hopefully expand into more sources, but will begin with Yodlee and Plaid.

It's important to note that some of these companies have manual requests for data 
deletion (ahem, Plaid) but in the future they should be able to create an automated
way of doing this, making it easier to periodically delete your footprint off of
their systems.
